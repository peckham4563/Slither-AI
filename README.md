## Description

SlitherAI is a single page web application built using the MERN stack, which showcases an implementation of Deep Q Network (DQN) Reinforcement Learning. The project utilizes qTables to automate the classic Snake Game, and to enable the reinforcement learning algorithm to learn and improve its gameplay over time. In addition to showcasing the DQN algorithm, this project also demonstrates proficiency with web development technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the SlitherAI application, it can be accessed through its hosted website. Users can interact with the Run button in the Main Game tab to start and observe the gameplay. The application is meant to serve as an example of how DQN Reinforcement Learning can be applied to a classic game like Snake, and as a starting point for building more complex RL agents for other games and environments.
