      <h1>Alexander</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Alexander Peckham and I live in Houston, Texas. I enjoy sports, mechanics, and spending time with my dogs. I have been a student at the University of Houston since 2018 in pursuit of a bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering. However, I decided to take a break to enroll in the Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp through UT Austin. I hope to be able to obtain a job after the bootcamp to help me pursue my interests.

      I am a veteran, who has served in both Afghanistan and Iraq. While in the Army, I served as a sys admin, and as a military Intelligence Analyst. I wrote a Book on Blender Geometry nodes that currently sells on Amazon. I am seeking to improve myself and my living conditions by attending the coding bootcamp.

      <h1>Matthew</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Matthew Walker and I live in Austin, Texas. I am 19 years old, and I enjoy working out, coding, and playing basketball. My plan is to go to UT and find a job in software hopefully, Apple later down the line. I enjoy both art and coding, so web development is a good way to express art through the design feature, which is the reason I chose this course. I plan to learn a lot more languages after this course such as Python, the C languages, and possibly swift for Apple. Thank you, gg.
      </p>
